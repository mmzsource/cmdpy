Cloned from https://github.com/rdegges/skele-cli.git as a basis for my 'prn' (or print) cmdline program.

Nothing fancy, just testing the template. Want to build *maintainable* cmdline programs. This seems to be a good way.

Usage
-----

Install the library (and all development dependencies):

    $ pip install -e .[test]

Run all tests for this project:

    $ python setup.py test
